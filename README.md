# Rust Todo API

## Overview

This is a simple Todo API built using the Actix framework in Rust. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete todo items.

I'm doing that that project for learning purpose.

## Running the API

To run the API, ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed. Then, clone the repository and run the following commands:

```bash
cargo run
```

The API will be available at http://localhost:8080.

## Swagger Documentation

You can also use Swagger to interact with the API.

Swagger documentation is available at http://localhost:8080/swagger/.
